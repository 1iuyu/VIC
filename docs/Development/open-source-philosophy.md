# VIC Model Open Source Philosophy

VIC is Open Source software.  We have licensed the source code with the [GNU GPL v2.0 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html).  This license provides very few restrictions on use.

Our rationale for moving the VIC model development to the open source community is that we want:
- to encourage other researchers and developers to contribute to the VIC development,  and
- to facilitate transparent development and use of the model

## Official Support

The VIC development community assumes the role of a limited scope of official support.

- Coordination of model development, bug fixes, and releases.
- Distribution of model [documentation](http://vic.readthedocs.org) and [source code](https://github.com/UW-Hydro/VIC)

## Unsupported

Due to limited resources, there is not official support for some of the tasks related to using VIC.  We expected that the user comes prepared with some understanding of the model and scientific computing.  As such, these items are specifically not supported by the VIC development community:

- Building and running the VIC model on platforms other than LINUX, UNIX, and OSX.
- Using LINUX, UNIX, or OSX operating systems.
- Development of project specific features.
- Configuring individual model applications.
