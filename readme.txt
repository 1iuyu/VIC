VIC (Liang et al., 1994) is a macroscale hydrologic model that solves full water and energy balances, originally 
developed by Xu Liang at the University of Washington. VIC is a research model and in its various forms it has 
been applied to most of the major river basins around the world, as well as being applied globally. If you make use 
of this model, please acknowledge the appropriate references listed on the references page 
(http://www.hydro.washington.edu/Lettenmaier/Models/VIC/Documentation/References.shtml).

Development and maintenance of the current official version of the VIC model is conducted at the University of 
Washington, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, under the direction of Dennis P. Lettenmaier. 
Every new application addresses new problems and conditions which the model may not currently be able to handle, 
and as such the model is always under development. For information about the current release of the VIC model send
e-mail to vicadmin@hydro.washington.edu. Please include "VIC Model" in the subject line.
